Long before the current age, the Necrons were an advanced and powerful
civilization. Known as the 'Necrontyr,' their existence was marred by a
relentless hunger for power and a thirst for immortality. In their pursuit of
these ambitions, they entered into a Faustian pact with mysterious cosmic
beings known as the C'tan.

The Necrontyr were transformed into soulless, mechanical beings called the
'Necrons' in exchange for extended life. Their flesh turned to metal, and their
consciousnesses were bound to intricate machine bodies. These soulless warriors
served the C'tan with unwavering loyalty.

A devastating war between the Necrons and the ancient Eldari, once a thriving
civilization, reshaped the galaxy. The Necrons retreated to dormant tombs
scattered across the stars, awaiting the day they would reawaken and reclaim
their dominion over the universe.

As you decipher the hieroglyphs, you catch glimpses of this dark history,
filled with promises of power, immortality, and a looming sense of malevolence.
